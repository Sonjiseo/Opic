Hi there, How are you? 
My Korean name is *Jiseo Son* and my English name is *Sam*
Recently I have a problem. 

I used to travel abroad at least twice a year.
But, I've been too busy with work. So, I haven't been able to travel for the past 2 years.
I really love experiencing new cultures such as the foods, the people, the language and so on.
So, I'm planning to travel to New york this year. 
I want to make lots of great memories by talking with local people and getting to know their culture
That's actually the reason I started studying English.

Ava, I'm very nervous right now. Because of this OPIc test.
But, I'll try to do my best for getting high score.
Wish me good luck, Bye

## Movies

### 1. Genres / types / kinds ✔️

> - 로맨스 films
> - First, 많은 감정을 느끼게 해줌
>   - Me before You 영화에서 사랑의 행복과 슬픔을 같이 느낄 수 있음
> - Next, 많은 중요한 것을 가르쳐줌
>   - About Time에서 사랑이 아니라, 소중한 사람들과의 시간을 알 수 있음
> - Overall, 달콤하거나 재밌기만 한게 아니라, 슬플 때도 있지만, 사랑하는 사람들에 대해 다시 생각해보게함

I think I love enjoying romance films

**First of all,** romantic movies help me feel many different emotions.
**For example,** the movie *Me Before You* shows how man slowly starts to feel love.
It's not just about the happiness of being in love, but also the sadness that can come with it.

**Next,** romantic movies teach me something important.
They don't just handle the feeling of love.
They show about spending time with someone you love
**For example,** About Time is my favorite romantic movie.
in the movie, the main character does time travel to go back to the moments of love.
But he realizes that every time he travels, the good memories also disappear.

**For these reasons,** I like romance movies.
They are not just sweet and fun. Sometimes it makes me sad.
But, They make me think again about the people I love.

### 2. Actors ✔️

> - 짐캐리
> - 유머러스 함
>   - 트루먼쇼 : 표정만으로도 행복함
>   - 난 감정 표현이 서툴러서 배우고 싶음
> - Delicate 감정도 잘 표현함 (expressing)
>   - 이터널 선샤인 : 슬픔과 사랑을 잘 표현(describe)
> - 최근 영화는 좀 silly 해서 안봄

I like Jim Carrey the most.

**The first reason is** he is very ~~h~~umorous.
**For example,** the first movie I saw him was Truman**'s** show.
In that movie, I realized that a person can make others happy just with facial expressions.
To be honest, I'm not good at showing my emotions, That's something I really want to learn and improve.

**Next,** He is also good at expressing **delicate** emotions. 
Some people know him as a funny actor and I also used to think like that.
But after watching the movie Eternal sunshine, I saw a different side of him.
In that movie, he plays a quite and emotional man which is very different from previous roles.
However, he describes feelings of sadness and love really well.
After that, I started to like him as a real actor not just a funny actor.

His recent movie, the sonic series. Actually the role looked too silly for me.
so I haven't watched them.
But, I always try to check if he has new movies coming out. because I'm still a big fan of him.

**Overall**, I really favor him the best

### 2. Routine/ Before and after movies ✔️

> [Items]
>
> Before / Concession stand(매점), window shopping, purchase tickets(how)
> After / Eat out, 결말찾아보기, 스포해버리기, give a.rating, goods 사기

> - 영화 보기 전
>   - 누구랑 볼지, 뭐볼지, 팝콘/티켓 사기
> - 영화 보고 난 다음
>   - 자리 청소/정리, 영화 토론, 외식, 평점 남기기(leave a rating)

**When it comes to** going to the movies, I have some routines.

**First**, before movies. 
I usually figure out who I'm going with, because I've never watched a movie alone at the theater.
I normally go there with my friend or family.
Then, we decide what to watch. In most cases, I follow their opinion .
After that we purchase our tickets, popcorn and soda.

**Next**, after movies, I clean up and organize my seat and ask them how the movie is.
And we have a meal and talk more about the movie.
If the movie is great or disappointing, I make sure to leave a rating about the movie.

**Overall**, these are my routines.

### 3. Memorable movie / (worst movie 도 이름만 생각해보기) ✔️

> - 보헤미안 랩소디 / 유일하게 영화관에서 2번 본 영화
> - Rami Malek
>   - 닮은 것 뿐 아니라, 그의 감정도 잘 표현
> - 스토리 라인 Perfect
>   - 퀸의 여정, 노래를 들었어도 퀸은 안궁금
>   - Stadium에서 보헤미안 랩소디 부른 것이 짱 - 들을 때 마다 생각남..관중이된 기분

**One of the most memorable movies is** *Bohemian Rhapsody*.
It's actually the only one movie I've watched twice in the theater.

**First**, Rami Malek who played Freddie Mercury was an amazing actor.
He didn’t just look like Freddie Mercury, he captured his emotions well, too.

**Next**, the storyline is just perfect.
It tells the story of the legendary rock band Queen and their journey.

To be honest, I've heard their songs many times before, but I've never wondered who they were.
Anyway, It wasn't one of those boring documentaries about celebrity's life.
It shows what each of their songs are meant to them.

**My favorite scene is** when they perform Bohemian Rhapsody as the opening song at a large stadium. 
Whenever I listen to that song, I feel like I'm one of the people in that stadium.
Maybe that's why the movie is titled as Bohemian Rhapsody, not Queen.

**Overall**, The movie Bohemian Rhapsody is more than just memorable. It's unforgettable for me.

### 11. Role playing / 영화 예매 ✔️

### 12. Role playing / 문제 발생 ✔️

> Exchange 💬 into the right ones, full/partial refund

**Hello, there. My name is Sam.**
**Actually, I have a problem** with my movie tickets.

First, I think I received the wrong tickets from you. 
I mean I reserved the tickets for the movie "F1", but the title of the tickets I was given is "Superman". 

Also, I definitely booked the tickets for the 4DX movie, but the tickets say they are for the regular screen room. 
There must be a huge mistake from you.

**To fix this problem/issue, I have two alternatives.**
First, I'd like to exchange the tickets into the right ones. 
**Alternatively**, can you give me a full refund?

**Anyway, please let me know the best option. Bye.**

**I'm calling because I'd like to ask you** about the cool movie you've watched a few days ago.

**First**, what's the title and genre of the movie?
As you know, I'm not really into horror movies. I’d rather watch a romance.

**Next**, How long is the movie? 
If it's more than two and a half hours, I'd like to watch it on the weekend ==when I more flexible==

As you know, we've watched The Lord of the Rings together before, and  It was so long I fell asleep.

**Lastly**, what was the movie about? Can you tell me a little bit about the story?

**Anyway, please call me back when you get this. Bye**

### 13. 영화과 너무 노잼 인데, 떠나고 싶어요 ✔️

> 문제: 영화의 이전 시리즈(the previous movies in the series) 안봄, acting도 bad
>
> 1. 스타벅스가서 책 읽고 있기
> 2. 같이 가서 집가서 이전 시리즈 보기

Hey, Brian

I'm sorry I have a problem with this movie.
The problem is that I feel really bored with the movie.

I haven't seen the previous **movies** **in the series**, so I couldn't really understand the story.
Also, the actor's acting was so bad. I cannot focus on it.

Maybe it’s because I don’t really know who the actors are.

to fix this problem, I have two alternatives.
so I’ll go ahead and wait at Starbuck while reading some books.
Alternatively, maybe we could go out together and watch the previous movies in the series at home. 
They will be still fun to watch them again.
Anyway, please let me know the best option.



### 14. 과거 vs 현재 뭐가 다르냐? (시제가 과거랑 현재가 섞임) ✔️

> - 과거 : 인간의 재능 human talent
>   - 배우, 감독 다 잘해야함, 유명배우 감독(톰 크루즈, 크리스토퍼 놀란)도 이 시대 나옴
> - 오늘 : 제작의 많은 부분을 디지털 기술이 대체함
>   - CGI(Computer Generated Imagery), Avatar

There are some differences between the past and present about movies

**First**, in the past, Human talent was much more important.

Actors had to be good at every thing such as acting, action scenes, emotional expressions and so on.

And Directors had to put every thing together to make the movie like real,

I think most of the famous actors and directors we still know today came from that time like Tom Cruise and Christopher Nolan.

**However, these days,** Many parts of production have been replaced by digital technology.

Actors no longer have to do dangerous scenes and directors don't have to put much effort into building real sets

Even so, CGI which stands for Computer Generated Imagery helps us experience movies in a more impressive way than before.

**For example,** the movie *Avatar* has remarkable visual effects, regardless of the storyline.

**Overall**, I think the best movies come out when CGI supports human talent while preserving it.

### 15. 요즘 영화에 관해서 사람들이 말하는 우려, 걱정 ✔️

> - 기존 영화 산업이 힘듬(traditional side is struggling)
> - 영화관 잘안감
>   - Streaming platform 의 발달 - 집에서 보는 게 좋음
> - 트럼프 정부의 impose a 100% tariff **on** the movie
>   - 한국에서 영화보는데 $20... 더 나빠질 것 같음
>
> tariff issues usually **end up** affecting consumers.

**When it comes to** concerns in the movie industry, people say that the traditional side is struggling these days.

**First**, people don’t go to the theater as often as they used to.
For me, I go to the theater maybe once a year, if at all.
That's because these days there are many streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon prime.
People can watch movies at home in a comfortable atmosphere without going to the theater.
They can even enjoy them with their favorite food, not just popcorn or soda.

**Next**, there is the recent tariff issue. [태맆]

The Trump administration has announced several new policies about tariffs, and the movie industry is no exception.

I don’t remember the exact title. But according to a CNN article I read recently, they decided to impose a 100% tariff on the movie industry as well.

There might be some reasons or positions between the countries, but from my experience, tariff issues usually end up affecting consumers.

**Even in Korea**, we already pay more than 20 dollars per person to watch a movie at the theater.

Ticket prices are already high, and extra tariffs could make it worse.

So, I’m worried that this will make people spend even less.

**Overall**, I think these are some of the main concerns in today’s movie industry.

## Musics

### 1. Genre ✔️

> - Jazz (Jazz pop > traditional jazz)
> - Special charm that draws me in before I know it
>   - First Jazz bar...not just fancy bar... meaning behind lyrics.
> - Feel classy
>   - Don't Know Why by Norah Jones
>   - Gentleman, Main character in sad movie

**I think I really enjoy** jazz music. To be more specific, I prefer jazz pop to traditional jazz.

**First,** jazz has special charm that draws me in before I know it.
I remember the first time I went to a jazz bar with my friends.
I used to listen to K-pop, so jazz was a completely / new kind of music to me.
To be honest, I thought a jazz bar was / nothing more than a fancy bar.
However, at some point, I realized that we were just sitting there, focused on the stage.
We stopped talking and started imagining the meaning behind the lyrics.

**Next,** Jazz makes me feel classy.
Whenever I go through something emotional, I spend some time alone, listening to jazz.
One of my favorite songs is Don't Know Why by Norah Jones.
When I close my eyes and listen, it changes how I feel.
On good days, it makes me feel like a classy gentleman.
On the other hand, On sad days, it makes me feel like the main character in a sad movie.
Jazz makes my emotions feel more meaningful and deep.

**Overall,** these are the reasons why I love jazz music.

### 2. routine (2 mins under) ✔️

> - 공부/일 (집중 필요)
>   - Upbeat songs, EDM, K-pop, The drum by Alan Walker, noise-canceling AirPods.
> - 운전
>   - Jazz, without worrying about anyone hearing me
>   - Turn up the volume and let the music fill the car

**When it comes to** listening to music, I have some routines.
And It depends on situations.

**First,** when I listen to music while working or studying, I need to stay focused.
So, I usually listen to upbeat songs with little or no meaningful lyrics, like EDM or some K-pop songs.
Among them, my favorite song is The Drum by Alan Walker.
This song makes me feel excited and energetic, it helps me work or study more effectively.
Also, I always make sure to listen to them using my noise-cancelling AirPods.

**The next routine is about** the music I listen to when I drive.
Driving is one of the few times I’m alone, so I listen to jazz which is my favorite genre[쟌러].
That's because I can sing along without worrying about anyone hearing me.
Naturally, I turn up the volume and let the music fill the car

**Overall,** these are my routines about the music.



### 3. 나의 음악감상, 과거/현재 비교 ✔️

> Music tates
>
> - In the past
>   - Upbeat songs, K-pop, Karaoke
> - These days
>   - Calm, quiet music
>   - Sunrise 

**When it comes to** my music tastes, there are some differences between the past and the present.

**First, in the past,** I used to prefer upbeat songs or ones that were easy to sing along to, like K-pop.
That’s because, when I was younger, I often spent time with my friends at karaoke.[ki]
We mostly sang K-pop songs there, and they were not only easy to sing along. but also energetic and fun.
No matter what anyone said, in those moments, we sang like we were real idols.

**However, these days,** I prefer calm and quiet music.
As my life has gotten busier, I listen to music to relax, not to get excited.
What’s more, as I’ve grown older, I’ve started to understand the meaning behind lyrics more deeply
Because of that, I like the kind of music I mentioned earlier, which touches me more emotionally.
Recently, I’ve been listening to "Sunrise" by Norah Jones and it helps me imagine a peaceful life.

One thing that hasn’t changed is both still give me pleasure.

**Overall,** these are the differences between the past and the present.

### 3. 콘서트(Concert or Live music) 들은 경험,언제,누구랑,누구의 공유 ✔️

> 성시경 콘서트 (2023, 연세대) + 티켓 가격 100달러? 걱정 ㄴㄴ

Actually, I haven’t been to many concerts. 
The only concert I’ve ever been to was by Sung Si Kyung, who is a well-known Korean singer.
It was held at Yonsei University in 2023, and I went there with my wife.

Listening to a song live was not only more impressive than the recorded one, but it's also a fantastic experience where I could feel the energy of the crowd.
Following the crowd, I waved my hands, clapped along to the beat, cheered loudly, and sang along with the songs.
Those are moments I still remember clearly.

And I remember the ticket was over 100 dollars per person. 
Actually, It's pretty expensive for me.
But when I think about how touching that moment was, the price didn’t matter at all.
I'd gladly go again anytime as long as I'm with the people I love

### 11. An MP3 player 추천받는 질문(전화) ✔️

> 브랜드 추천, 사용 시간, 물리적 버튼

### 12. 친구를 빌려서 쓰다 망가트림, 어쩌다 망가졌는지, 현재 상태, 2가지 최대한 빨리 동작하는 기기를 받도록 ✔️

> 세탁기에 같이 넣고 돌려버림 : 사설 수리점에서 빠르게 고쳐주겠다, 같은 모델을 사주겠어

### 13. 기기가 고장나고 고쳐 써 먹었는지 ✔️

> 중국산 충전기 동작 안함 / 무선 충전기 사용, 정품 충전기, 교체

### 15. 최신 음악 기기에 대해 설명 ✅

> - Open-ear earbuds
>  - Go directly into your ears,
> - 사고 싶다 / 귀 아파, 달리기 좋아

**When it comes to** the latest electronic music gadgets(devices), 

I think people are talking about open-ear earbuds these days.



**First,** I'd like to tell you about the open-ear earbuds in detail.

They’re kind of a new style of earbuds.

Normally, earbuds go directly into your ears, but these don't.

<u>They just</u> hang on your ears like earrings.

Out of all the new products coming out these days, I think the Ultra Open Earbuds from Bose are the best.

Since it’s a new style, it might look pretty unusual at first.

But this product has a really cool design, so it actually looks great.

And of course, the most important thing is the sound quality — but it’s Bose, so there’s no need to say more.



**Also,** I really want to purchase them

I already have AirPods Pro which is the most popular, but wearing regular in-ear earbuds like them for a long time is painful for my ears.

So I can’t wear them for more than two hours.

According to many reviews on the official website, 

these don’t hurt users ears, so they can solve that problem.

What’s more, they’re lightweight and let me hear the sounds around me while listening to music, 

so I can keep them on all day



**Overall,** I think open-ear earbuds are the latest type of earbuds.

## 공원

### 공원 설명 ✔️

> - 불당 공원
>   - 가까워요, 

**I think** I love going to a park and spending time there.

Just going to a park makes me feel healthier.



**First,** I think Buldang Park is the one I like and visit most often.

The park is located next to City Hall in Cheonan, where I live.

I usually go there on Sundays if the weather is nice.

Since dogs are allowed==[얼라우드]== there, a lot of people, including me, enjoy walking their dogs.



**Next,** there are some reasons why I like there

I usually prefer bigger parks, and this one is the biggest neaby.

And it has clean restrooms, lots of benches, and some outdoor gym equipment.

What’s more, they always play classical music, and there's a trail along a tree-covered hill.

When I walk along there while listening to the music, it feels like I’m in a forest.



**Overall,** that’s why I really like this park.

### 공원 루틴 ✅

> - before
>   - Check the weater
>   - Find a park
>   - Allow dogs
>   - Change into comfortables, dog waste bags
> - After 
>   - Put a harness
>   - Sit on a beach, take a short break
>   - Take a selfies with ... , post on Instagram

**When we talk about** going to a park, **I have some routines**



**First**, before I go to a park,

I usually check the weather because I like sunny days the most.

Then, I try to find a park near my place

Of course, I also make sure the park allows dogs to walk my dog.

After that, I change into comfortable clothes and prepare dog waste bags and some cold water.



**Next,** when I arrive at a park, 

I put a harness(하네스) on my dog and plan our walking route.

Actually, I usually just walk instead of running.

During the walk, I sometimes sit on a bench and take a short break

Sometimes I throw my dog’s toys and play with her. I also take selfies with her to post on Instagram.



**Overall,** these are my routines when I go to a park.

### Memorable park 사건 ✅

> - Vacation homework
>   - Outdoor activity
>   - Imitate Tiger Woods' swing
>   - Ridiculous..

**I think** the most memorable event in a park for me was golfing there.

**First,** to be more specific about it, 

it was when I was around thirteen.

In Korea, vacation homework is important.

At that time, one of my vacation assignments  was to experience a new outdoor activity.

Since the vacation was almost over, I decided to play golf which is my father’s hobby.

I took the shortest one of my father's golf clubs and went to the park nearby.

Then, I tried to imitate *Tiger Woods*’s swing I had looked up on the internet.

To be exact, I didn’t actually play golf, I just pretended to, because I only did practice swings without a ball.

When I think about how ridiculous I must have looked to people, it still makes me laugh.

**Overall,** I’ve actually started learning real golf now, but I will never play golf in a park again.

### 11. 친구와 공원에 가기로 하는 약속 잡기(RP, Call, 돌려쓸 수 있을 만큼 고퀄) ✅

> Are you free this Sunday? I mean the 7th.
>
> I can pick you up by my car, How about meeting in front of the CVS near your place?

**Hi Angela, This is Sam.**
**I'm calling because I'd like to** go to the park we went before together
It's been a long time since we hung out.
**So, let me ask you some questions**

**First,** Are you free this Saturday, I mean the 16th?
According to the weather forecast, it’s gonna be really sunny.

**Next,** Can I bring my dog so we can go for a walk together?
Because you told me before you wanted to see her.

**Lastly**, I can pick you up by my car. How about meeting in front of the CVS near your place?

**Anyway, please call me back when you get this. Bye.**

### 12.친구와 공원가기로 이미 했는데, 나의 사정으로 약속을 취소해야함. 대안 2개 ✅

**Hi Angela, this is Sam.**

We are supposed to go to the park this Saturday, right?

I’m really sorry, but I **won’t be able to make it.**

That’s because I completely forgot it’s my wife’s birthday on that day. 

And as you know, my wife can be pretty scary. 

I was really looking forward to having chicken and beer at the park together,

 so I’m really disappointed.

**To fix the problem, I have two alternatives.**
**First,** how about going to a nearby park tonight?
I can purchase some snacks and beer by CVS in front of the park.

**Alternatively,** how about rescheduling for next Saturday?
Of course, the chicken and beer will be on me.

Again, I’m really sorry.
**please let me know the best option. Bye**

### 13. 기억에 남는 사건 (재탕)

### 14. 공원에서의 어른 vs 아이 활동 비교 ✅

> - 어른의 activities
>   - Light jogging
>   - bring food and drinks
>   - have a picnic
>   - Play with their kids.
>   - Spend time relaxing or making memories
> - 아이들의 activities
>   - Do more active things
>   - Ride bikes, play ball games, run
>   - nephew
>     - He was in his element
>     - I cannot keep up with his energy
>     - Burn energy, recharge

**When it comes to** activities in a park, **there are some differences and similarities between** children **and** adults.



**First,** As for/Regarding adults' activities in a park.

They usually go for a walk or sometimes do light jogging.

Some people run in groups, and running crews are a big trend in South Korea right now.

Sometimes they bring food and drinks to have a picnic, and parents take photos while playing with their kids.

In my opinion, adults usually spend more time relaxing or making memories than doing active things.



**Next,** As for children's activities in a park.

They do more active things, just like I used to.

For example, they enjoy riding bikes, playing ball games, and running.

Recently, I went to the park near my place with my nephew.

At the park, he was totally in his element.

I was having fun too, but I just couldn’t **keep up with** his energy / 따라 잡다, 뒤쳐지지 않다

I think children use a park to burn energy, while adults use it to recharge.

Still, they each enjoy a place in their own way.



**Overall, I think these are the differences and smulisd between** children **and** adults.



### 14. 자주 가는 공원 2개 비교 ✅

> - 불당 공원 성정 공원
> - Have a lot in common
>   - 10 mins, convenient
>   - Not just nice-looking
>   - Allow dogs
>   - Managed by my city
>   - Starbucks, grab an iced Americano
> - Differences
>   - Guess from the names
>   - Lake, forest
>   - Park in the city center
>   - Timid, keep a closer eye on her

When it comes to the parks I visit most often, I’d like to talk about Buldang Park and Seongjeong Lake Park, which are my favorites.



First, these two parks have a lot in common.

Both are just about ten minutes from my place, which makes them very convenient to visit.

For me, the best park is close and easy to visit, not just nice-looking.

Of course, both parks allow**[얼라우]** dogs and are kept clean since they’re managed by my city.

Plus, there’s Starbucks right at the entrance of each park, so I usually grab an iced Americano and walk my dog.



However, there are also some differences.

As you can guess from the names, one has a lake --  and the other doesn’t.

If I wanna walk by the water, I go to Seongjeong Lake Park.

But if I want to walk through the forest, I head to Buldang Park.

Around the lake park, there are fancier coffee places and restaurants, while the other park feels more like park in the city center.

My dog is a little timid, so when I take her to the more crowded lake park I **keep a / closer eye on** her.



Overall, these are the similarities and differences between the two parks, they’re both great places to spend time.



### 15. 공공 공원이 직면한 문제 ✅

> - Drinking in public parks
>   - Not very strict about ~
>   - Hang out with my friends
> - Vandalism
>   - Damage the facilities
>   - Vandalize public property with graffiti.

**When it comes to** problems public parks face, people usually talk about drinking and vandalism.

**First**, one concern is drinking in public parks.
In South Korea, the rules are not very strict about drinking in these places.
I’ve also enjoyed hanging out with friends at Han River Park, drinking beer and eating snacks.
Light drinking, like one or two cans of beer, doesn’t usually cause big problems.
But sometimes, some people get really drunk. They get loud, use bad language, and act rudely.
This is a real problem because many families visit parks, including young children. Such behavior can have a bad influence on the children and disturb their rest.

**Next**, there’s vandalism.

Most parks in South Korea are public spaces.

Some people, including drunk ones, sometimes damage the facilities made for citizens’ convenience.

They might play roughly with the facilities or vandalize public property with graffiti.

For example, just yesterday when I was walking my dog, I saw a bench covered with bad words.

I recently saw an article saying some people even steal some plants from public parks, which seems to be a serious issue.

**Overall**, these are some of the main problems public parks face.

I think one of my favorite domestic destination is Seoul - the capital city of South Korea.



First, there are many things to enjoy.

I actually live in a quiet countryside town. So when I go on dates or hang out with my friends, I often visit Seoul.

That's because there are always new things to experience like night markets, pop-up stores, various events and so on.

For example, last month I went to Seoul with my wife.

We took a yacht[야트] on the Han River and enjoyed a glass of wine while looking at the beautiful night view of the city.

It was such a wonderful memory.



Next, it's very convenient to get around.

In Seoul, I can go anywhere just by subway.

If I set my destination on any popular map application on my phone.

It gives me all the information I need.

For example, it shows the exit number near my destination, the expected train arrival time, and the door number for the fastest transfer. (And things like that)

Even if you miss a train, the next one usually comes within five minutes.

So, I never take my own car when I visit Seoul.



Overall, that’s why I go to Seoul so often.

When it comes to preparing for a trip, I have some routines

First, there are a few things I usually pack in my bag.
I always bring my travel card, which is a rechargeable card similar to a debit card.
That way, I only need to exchange a minimal amount of cash.
I also take my international driver’s license, even if I don’t plan to drive during the trip, just in case an unexpected situation **comes up**.

Next, There are also a few things I make sure to check before I leave.
I find a place for my dog to stay while I’m traveling, like my parents’ house or a pet hotel.
I also note down the exact address and contact information of the hotels where I’ll be staying.
Plus, I download videos and music so I can enjoy them on the plane without an internet connection.
As you know, these days YouTube and Netflix allow you to download content for offline viewing.

Overall, there might be **other little things** I do, but these are the main routines

### 3. 어릴때 기억에 남는 (여행 간 거, 어디, 누구, 뭐 봄) ✅

> 

The most memorable trip from my childhood was my school trip in elementary school.



**First**, It was the (very) first time I had ever traveled without my parents.

Sure, our teachers were with us, but just sharing a room with my classmates was exciting.

Even though we were sleepy, we stayed up all night laughing and talking.

because if someone fell asleep first, the others would draw all over their face.

I stayed awake long enough to avoid that prank.



**Next**, The ending of the trip was not so great.

whenever I went on trips with my friends, we always ended up having pillow fights. That night was no different.

We were hitting each other with pillows like it was a battlefield. [배럴쁼드]

Then, something hard smacked my arm.

It was a kind of special pillow stuffed with some jade — the kind / every grandmather seemed to have.

I tried to ignore the pain and fell asleep, but the next morning, my arm was really swollen. [스월런]

My teacher took me to the hospital, and that’s when I found out I had a fracture.

So, for the rest of the trip, I sat on a bench with my arm in a cast, just watching my friends have fun.



**Overall**, this is my memorable domestic travel when I was younger.

When it comes to traveling these days, people mostly talk about visa issues and safety.

First, visa and immigration checks have become much stricter.
Sometimes travelers are even denied entry at the airport and have to go back home.
I had a similar experience when I visited China last April.
The immigration line was much longer than usual, and the officers asked me many detailed questions.
That’s when I realized entry procedures are tougher now, and this can be very stressful.

Second, safety is also a big concern.
Conflict zones or sudden protests can make travelers nervous.
Even countries that used to feel safe are no longer exceptions.
For example, a few months ago, there was unrest in Los Angeles, and it reminded me that unexpected things can happen anywhere.
These events not only make traveling stressful but also sometimes force people to change or cancel their plans.
That’s why I always check safety information before I travel, because I believe safety comes first.

Overall, stricter immigration checks and safety issues are two major concerns these days. Travelers need to be more careful.

**When we talk about** things I usually do at a travel destination, I have some routines.



**First**, there are some common routines I've had for a long time.

As soon as I arrive, I go straight to my accommodation, check in, and drop off my luggage.

On the first day, I don't start sightseeing right away. Instead, I like to explore the neighborhood around my accommodation. I usually stop by a CVS to grab some water and some local snacks.

Since I'm a smoker, I also like to try different kinds of local cigarettes during my trip. 

Of course, If I find one that I really enjoy, I always purchase one carton at the duty-free shop before I leave the country.



**Next**, I also have a photo routine that I really enjoy these days.

I choose a special theme for each trip and take pictures that match it

Those themes usually reflect the character of the destination

Sometimes it's a certain pose, and other times it's small souvenir from the place.

It makes the trip more memorable and fun.

For instance, when I traveled to Osaka, Japan recently, I copied the famous pose, Glico-san pose in Dotonbori. 

That’s the pose that the runner has both arms up while crossing the finish line.

Actually, I posed like that in almost all my Osaka photos, so now I don’t have any normal ones at all.

It was hilarious[hɪˈleəriəs], and now those photos are the highlight of that trip



**Overall**, these are my routines when I travel.

Hello there, this is Sam.



I'm calling because I'm interested in a trip to Busan these days.

Because, I've heard Haeundae Beach is great to enjoy in September.

So, I'd like to travel from Sep 1st to Sep 5th and I have some questions.

**First**, are there any flight tickets available for those periods?

Specifically, I prefer a morning departure and an evening return. Also If possible, I'd like to fly with Korean Air

Because I earn miles.

**Next**, Could you tell me about the hotels that offer an airport shuttle?

My luggage is pretty large, So I'd rather take a shuttle than public transportation.

**Lastly**, do you have a travel guidebook or brochure for Busan?

It would be great if it includes activity suggestions, such as local food tour or an evening cruise.

Please call me back when you get this. Bye :D



### 11. 환불 불가 , 다음주 여행 취소 ✅

Hello there, this is Sam.



As you know, I booked a ticket with your agency last week for a trip to Boston.

The flight is scheduled to leave next Monday and return two weeks later

I know the ticket is non-refundable, but an unexpected issue came up with my U.S. visa.

it was about to expire so I reapplied, but I made a mistake in the application and it was rejected.

Now I need to visit the embassy to fix it and I don't think I can make it before Monday.

**To fix this problem**, I have 2 alternatives.

First, Could you reschedule my ticket for about two weeks later?

According to the embassy, I should be able to get my visa within that period.

Alternatively, is it possible to convert the ticket into mileage instead of getting a refund?

As soon as I receive my visa, I will purchase the ticket right away.

Anyway, please call me back and let me know which option works best. Bye :D

Hello Brian, this is Sam.



You remember we were supposed to go to the Philippines from August 21st to 25th, right?

I just talked to the travel agency, and they said we cannot take that trip on those periods.

I'm pretty upset, since we already booked the hotel and the activities.

But Don't worry, I'll handle the cancellations of them.

Anyway, I was really looking forward to spending our vacation with the nice beach with you.

So, to fix this problem, I have two alternatives.



First, If you're free a month later, I mean around the 1st week of September. How about rescheduling for then?

The agency said it's definitely possible, and the weather should be a litter cooler so we can enjoy it more.

Alternatively, If you don't mind, we could go to Bali instead.

It might be a little more expensive, but I heard the beaches there are amazing,

Because I heard the beaches there are incredible.

We might actually have an even better time.



Please call me back with the best option. Bye

### 14. 여행의 과거 현재 비교 / Max 10년 ✅

> - 여행 과정이 쉬워짐
> - Fingerprint, facial recognition, online duty-free shop, e-SIM, Travel card
> - Travel platforms
>   - Airbnb "Don't go there, live there" , Uber, Lyft, AI translator

When it comes to traveling, I'd like to tell you how convenient it is today compared to the past.



First, the process of going on a trip is much easier now.

In the past, I had to apply for a visa in person and wait in long lines at immigration.

But now, I can apply online and pass through the airport much more smoothly[스무즐리] using fingerprint or facial recognition[레커그==니==션].

Even duty-free shopping has become simpler. Instead of spending a lot of time at the airport, I just order online in advance and pick it up.

Also, I used to buy a physical SIM card at a store either after arriving or before departing. But now with an e-SIM, I can activate it just by changing a few phone settings.

Travel cards make things easier. I don’t need to carry a lot of cash. 

because I can exchange money right away through my banking app and use it like a debit card.
That's why I don’t make long checklists anymore, and I rarely buy package tours from travel agencies.



Next, there are many different travel platforms.

I used to stay at hotels when I traveled, but I prefer Airbnb now.

That's because it allows me to experience the local lifestyle, just like their slogan says, “Don’t go there, live there.”

Also, with services like Uber or Lyft, I don’t need to explain directions in a foreign language.
I can just enter my destination in the app, call a car, and pay directly through it.

And even if the driver asks me something in their own language, I don’t really need to worry anymore.

I can communicate with an AI translator. 

For example, when I recently went to Tokyo, I couldn’t speak Japanese at all.
But every time I had a trouble, I used Samsung Galaxy’s real-time AI translator, and it solved my communication problems right away.

Overall, technology has developed so much that traveling has become more convenient and enjoyable than in the past.

There are some differences between the past and the present in domestic travel. I’d like to talk about the difficulties of domestic travel over the last five years.

First, I’d like to talk about over-tourism. 

Compared to the past, I feel that too many people crowd into certain famous destinations, especially those promoted on social media like Instagram or X. This often ruins the experience for visitors, and in the case of natural spots, it can damage the environment quickly. For example, when I visited a famous restaurant on Jeju Island during my summer vacation last month, I had to wait about an hour just to get in. But by the time I entered, the most popular dish was already sold out. I was really disappointed, On Google Maps, I marked it so I won’t go there again.

Next, I’d like to mention aviition issues related to climate change. 

In recent years, with global warming, extreme turbulence seems to happen much more often, and sometimes It has even caused tragic accidents. Because of that, people tend to prefer major airlines that feel safer than low-cost carriers, so tickets are harder to get. Also, more travelers end up using trains or cars instead, which makes traffic even worse during vacation season.

Overall, I think these are the main reasons why traveling has become more difficult compared to the past five years.

When it comes to shopping in my country, I’d like to talk about both offline and online shopping.

First, As for offline shopping in Korea.
These days, big shopping centers are turning into complex-cultural **spaces** with spa, aquarium, movie theater, and kids’ zone, so people can spend the whole day there.
Traditional markets are also popular. Actually, I don’t buy clothes or electronics there, but I often go to enjoy street food or get fresh ingredients at cheap prices.
Also, CVS are everywhere. Even though I live in a small countryside town, they are often **right around the corner**.
They sell daily necessities[너쎄써팆], simple medicine, and even handle delivery services. 
According to an article I read recently, there are more than 55 thousand CVS, which is a lot compared to the size of South Korea.

Next, Regarding online shopping.
These days, same-day delivery is very common. 
I often use Coupang, which is like the Korean version of Amazon.
For about five dollars a month, I can use Rocket Delivery and get items the next day or even the same day. It’s much cheaper than Amazon Prime, which is around fifteen dollars. 
So, when I go on an unexpected trip, I always order what I need on Coupang and receive it early in the morning before leaving

Overall, I think these are the typical shopping malls and stores in my country.

When it comes to my favorite shopping centers, I'd like to talk about Starfield, 

First, there are so many things I can purchase.
Most of the brands I can find in a department store are also available at Starfield, and sometimes the prices are even cheaper.

They also hold a lot of collaboration events and pop-up stores with famous brands. But it’s not just about sales, they provide experience-based events where I can actually participate and try something myself.

Of course, people even say “We go to Starfield just to eat” because there are so many dining options. From famous chain restaurants to small food courts, I can find any type of cuisine there.

And they even sell cars. My wife actually bought her car there, and I still remember when we picked it up at the entrance of the mall, because so many people were staring at us and I felt embarrassed.

Next, there are also many things to enjoy besides shopping.
Sometimes I go there even if I don’t need to buy anything, just to relax or have fun.
On days when I need to recharge, I go to the spa inside Starfield to relieve my stress.
And when I’m in the mood for excitement, I go to *Sports Monster*, which is an indoor sports theme park.
It’s designed for both kids and adults, and I usually enjoy activities like the air track, cycling, and VR games.

There are also well-designed parks and resting spaces and resting areas, and even dogs are allowed. So I often go there with my wife to take a walk with our pet.

Overall, I think Starfield is one of the most iconic shopping malls in South Korea.

When it comes to shopping, I have some routines I always follow.

First, these are the routines I do before leaving home.
I usually check the weather first. 
Most of shopping malls I usually go to have outdoor parking lots, so I prefer going on clear days.
Also, I make a shopping list. 
To be honest, I don’t have strong self-control, so this helps me avoid overspending
I also check if there are any events or coupons available at the mall.
Finally, I change into comfortable clothes. For example, I wear a shirt, wide pants, and comfortable sneakers. 
This makes it much easier to try on clothes at the store.

Next, these are the routines I follow after arriving at the mall.
I take a picture of the parking spot first, so I won’t forget where I park.
Then, at the entrance, I look at the floor guide and plan my route based on the shopping list. Of course, I always check the pop-up stores or event sections on the first floor.
I usually shop from lower floors to upper floors, and I finish with a meal at a restaurant on the top floor.
On the way home, I stop by a Starbucks DT and grab an iced Americano to wrap up my day

Overall, these are my routines whenever I go shopping.

When we talk about shopping, there are some clear differences between the past and the present.

First, as for same-day delivery.
These days, people are always busy, so time has become even more valuable.
Same-day delivery really saves us time. 
In the past, if we needed something right away, we had to go to the store.
But now, we can receive items on the same day or the next day through services like Amazon Prime or Walmart+. 
Also, in South Korea, companies like Coupang or Market Kurly provide the same service. 
Of course, you need a membership, but the convenience is definitely worth it.

Next, shopping is becoming more unmanned.
Since labor costs keep rising, many stores now use self-checkout machines and kiosks. 
Shoppers can order by themselves or simply scan the barcode to check out.
When I visited San Francisco in 2023, I went to an Amazon Go, which is a fully unmanned store.
I just put things in my cart, and I didn’t need to scan the barcode of each item.
It was a very impressive experience.
Unfortunately, I heard Amazon reduced these stores because of high costs, but I still think it was a great attempt at automation.
What's more, in my country, I think unmanned stores have become really popular recently. They sell clothes, meal kits, and pet snacks, Some of them even sell coffee / robots make.

Overall, I think these are the main differences between the past and the present shopping.

When it comes to my favorite beach, I’d like to tell you about Mongdol Beach in South Korea.

First, Mongdol Beach is different from other well-known beaches in my country.
It’s located at the southern coast[코우스트], and it’s over an hour away from my hometown, but the coastal drive makes the trip really enjoyable**. What makes this place special** is that it’s covered with smooth pebbles[페블즈] instead of sand. When the waves come and go, **the sound of the water moving through the stones** is really relaxing, almost like nature’s own music. That sound alone is enough to make it my favorite beach.

Next, what I also like is the area around the beach.
There are many new fancy coffee places where you can sit on a terrace, have a cup of coffee, and enjoy the sound of nature. To be honest, it’s not as crowded as other famous beaches, which makes it even more relaxing. On top of that, you can enjoy fresh seafood at a reasonable price, and most places serve local specialties like oysters, grilled clams, and fish, which taste amazing after a day at the beach.

Overall, these are the reasons Mongdol Beach is my favorite place to relax.

Whenever I go to a beach, I have some routines.

First, I always pack a few things before I go.
I bring sunglasses and sunblock to protect myself, and an extra set of clothes in case I get wet. I also carry a small waterproof pouch for my phone, and sometimes some snacks and a cold drink. If I go with friends, I take my GoPro to capture fun moments together.

Next, there are a couple of things I usually do at a beach.
 I try to find a quiet spot, settle down, and take a walk on the sand. Since I don’t go often, I usually stay overnight. Before it gets dark, I like to paddle around in the shallow water for a while. At night, I enjoy a walk by the sea, and when I’m with friends, we sometimes do fireworks. In the morning, I wake up early to watch the sunrise, which is always the highlight of the trip.

Overall, these are my routines whenever I go to a beach.

When we talk about a memorable story at a beach, I’d like to talk about Taean Beach in Korea.

First, I had a really relaxing time there.
Last year, I went to a glamping site, which is basically luxury camping, right by the beach. It was my first time trying it, and it turned out to be so convenient. Each unit had everything—its own air conditioning, cooking facilities, and a bathroom. I just brought some food for a barbecue and some beer. Normally, going to the beach feels like a hassle with all the sand, wet clothes, and heavy bags, but this time I could just stay in one spot and fully relax.

Next, I had some special experiences there.
Everything I did was with the ocean right in front of me, which made it unforgettable. I had dinner while looking at the ocean, drank beer with my wife, and we even did some fireworks. They also provided firewood, so we built a campfire and enjoyed sitting around it on the beach. The most memorable part was waking up to warm sunlight and the sound of waves instead of an alarm. That moment was absolutely amazing.

Overall, Taean Beach is the most memorable beach for me, and I sometimes go back just to remind that memory.

Hello, this is Sam

I’m calling because I’m looking for a place to stay. 
I’ll be staying there for a six-month business assignment starting September 1st. 
Since the company will cover the cost, I’m mainly interested in monthly rent. 
Also, I’ll be living alone, so a one-bedroom with a living room would be enough for me. 
So, I have a couple of questions to ask.

First, could you email me some listings that match these conditions?
It would be great if they include pictures, so I can choose what I like and get back to you.

Second, do you have any places near a train station or a bus terminal?
On weekends, I plan to go back to my current home, so being close to transportation is really important for me.

Finally, I’m planning to visit that area this Friday after 3 p.m.
Would you be available then? I’ll bring my car, so we can go around and see the houses.

Anyway, please call me back, when you get this. Bye

Hi there, this is Sam.
I’m calling because one of the windows in my new place has a serious crack. I just moved in a short time ago, so it was quite a surprise to me. The thing is, tomorrow I already have a cleaning service coming to take care of the whole house, including the windows. That’s why I really need this glass fixed today. The window isn’t very large—maybe about half the size of a regular door.

I know it’s a lot to ask, but I have two alternatives. First, could you please send someone today to fix the window? I don’t mind paying extra. Also, if you need any information, I can check everything for you, like the size or a picture.

If that’s not possible, I can remove the window myself and bring it to your shop. Even if you only have used glass, It’s fine to replace it with the same size.

Please let me know what can be done as soon as possible. Thank you for your help. Bye.

When we talk about recycling in my country, I’d like to talk about the system in apartments.

**First**, in most apartment buildings, there is a designated recycling area on the ground floor.
People separate paper, plastics, cans, glass, and food waste. 

The bins are clearly marked, so it’s easy for everyone to follow. 

In the apartment where I live, we even separate things like old clothes, used cooking oil, and small electronics. The area is well-maintained, and the system makes recycling very simple and efficient for residents.

**Next**, for food waste, many apartments use smart bins with RFID technology.
These bins have a card reader and a scale. 

When you throw away food scraps, the machine scans your RFID card, weighs the trash, and charges a small fee based on the weight. This system makes people think twice before wasting food. According to an article I read recently, it has helped reduce food waste by tens of thousands of tons in Seoul. Later, the waste is recycled into soil for farms, animal feed, or even biogas.

Overall, this system is clear, and it makes recycling a normal part of life.

When it comes to recycling in Korea, I follow some routines.

First, I always rinse the recyclables.
I live in an apartment with a designated recycling area, but since I don’t have much storage, I usually keep the trash in the utility room until I take it out. Washing is important because otherwise it smells and attracts bugs.

Next, I try to make the trash smaller. I live on the 24th floor, so taking out the trash can be a hassle. To avoid going too often, I crush cans and press down plastic bottles. Glass bottles are different; because they can be dangerous, I keep them as they are. Paper is opened up and piled neatly.

On top of that, most apartments in Korea have special bins for used cooking oil, old clothes, small electronics, light bulbs, and batteries. I separate those and throw them out in the right bins.

Overall, that’s how I handle my recycling routine.

**When we talk about** recycling in my country, there are some clear differences between the past and the present.

**First**, when I was young, recycling wasn’t a big deal.
Recycling was promoted, but not many people cared. Even I used to throw plastics and regular trash together, and nobody seemed to mind. Back then, most of the recycling was actually done by retired seniors who collected paper, scrap metal, or glass bottles to sell for a little money.
**One thing I remember is that,** when I was a kid, my apartment complex had a flea market once a month.
But it wasn’t about selling for money. It was more like trading. People brought stuff they didn’t use at home and swapped them for their neighbors’ stuff. I thought it was really fun, and that memory still **sticks with me.**

**Today**, recycling has become very common.
As people’s concern for the environment has grown, especially about single-use items, both the government and companies have taken action. 

In many offices, paper cups were replaced with reusable cups, and eco[이코]-friendly packaging is now used. On the government side, there are policies that give people small rewards if they recycle properly. Also, in coffee places and restaurants, disposable items are banned by law. For example, if I go to Starbucks in Korea, I get my drink in a mug with a paper straw, and if I bring my own tumbler, I can get a discount.

**Overall**, recycling has become a normal part of life, and people should keep paying attention.

### 1. 우리나라의 지형 묘사 ✅📕

**When it comes to** the geography of South Korea, I’d like to talk about two things (I mean) the mountains and the seas.

**First**, South Korea is known for its mountains. 

About 75 percent of the land is covered with mountains, and the eastern part is especially mountainous. No matter where you are, you can usually reach a mountain within an hour. Since Korea has four distinct seasons, the scenery looks different all year round. **When I was young,** I didn’t like the mountains because my family often took me hiking, and I found it really tough. But now, I realize that having nature so close is actually a huge advantage, since it gives me a great place to rest and recharge.

**Next**, my country is a peninsula[페닌술라-], so three sides are surrounded by the seas. 

The other side borders North Korea, so it almost feels like an island. The West Sea is quite shallow, while the East Sea is much deeper. I prefer the East Sea because the water is more clear and the scenery is more beautiful. The east coast is also mountainous, so getting there is not always easy, but that makes the trip even more special.

**Overall**, I think these are some key features of South Korea’s geography.

### 2. 주변국 묘사 ✅📕

**When it comes to** South Korea’s neighboring countries, I’d like to talk about Japan.

**First of all**, Japan is very close to my country, so a lot of Koreans travel there often. 

It only takes a couple of hours by plane, and the culture feels familiar but also different, which makes it really interesting.

**Also**, Japan is famous for its food. 

Japanese dishes like sushi, ramen, and tempura are very popular in South Korea. 

Personally, I really enjoy sushi because it’s fresh and light, and whenever I visit Japan, I always look for a good sushi restaurant. 

I also enjoy ramen, and my favorite place is Ichiran Ramen.

**Next**, Japanese culture has a big influence around the world. 

For example, Japanese anime[아니메] and comics, called manga, are really popular. 

Many young people in Korea grew up watching Japanese cartoons, and I think they are part of everyday life now. 

Recently, I watched *Attack on Titan*, and it was really exciting.

**Finally**, I’d like to mention the people in Japan. 

They are usually very polite and well-mannered. 

When I traveled to Japan, I noticed that people bowed to greet each other, and they were very kind to visitors. That left a strong impression on me and made my trip even more pleasant.

**Overall**, these are some things I’d like to share about Japan.

### 3. 우리나라 야외 활동

> 등산, 수영, 낚시, 골프 ....지형 버무려...

I would like to tell you about how people in this country enjoy outdoor activities along with its landscape. 

Since South Korea has many mountains and hills, golf courses here are quite different from those in other countries. While most golf courses abroad are usually built on flat land with many lakes, ours are mostly located in hilly areas with beautiful natural surroundings.

For example, in Jeju Island and Gangwon-do, you can play golf while enjoying green landscapes with ocean views. So, golfing here feels like hiking.

On the other hand, Korea is also surrounded by the sea on three sides, which makes fishing popular as well. On the east coast, people enjoy fishing in the early morning while watching the sunrise. Since Korea is surrounded by the ocean on three sides, each coastline has different water temperatures and climates, so I travel around to catch various kinds of fish.

Overall, I think Korea’s unique geography (with its mountains and seas) gives  many ways to relax and have fun outdoors.

I’d like to talk about Pangyo, which has changed a lot over the past ten years.

**First**, the business environment has changed dramatically. 

<u>About ten years ago</u>, Pangyo was just a quiet place to live with some apartments and shops. 

<u>But now</u>, it’s often called the “Silicon Valley of South Korea”, because many IT companies have moved there. 

**For example**, Naver built its 헤드오피스 in Pangyo, and Kakao also opened its offices there. These two companies are very famous in Korea, so the area soon became a tech hub.

**Next**, life there has also gotten a lot better. 

<u>In the past</u>, there were only a few restaurants and small stores, so people often went to Seoul for shopping or entertainment. 

<u>But today</u>, Pangyo has modern shopping malls, trendy cafes, and cultural spaces. 

A large department store opened, and now many families spend their weekends there. 

Because of that, the area feels more **vibrant** than before.

**When I visited there last month**, I was amazed at how modern it was, with so many tech offices and startups. With my background in software programming, I thought I hope I can live there someday.

**Overall**, Pangyo has grown from a quiet town into a hub for technology and modern life.

First, the business environment has changed dramatically.
 → 첫째, 비즈니스 환경이 극적으로 변했습니다.

- change dramatically : 극적으로 변하다

About ten years ago, Pangyo was just a quiet place to **live with** some apartments and shops.
 → 약 10년 전만 해도, 판교는 아파트와 가게 몇 개가 있는 조용한 주거지였습니다.

But now, it’s often called the “Silicon Valley of South Korea”, because many IT companies have moved there.
 → 하지만 지금은 많은 IT 기업들이 들어서면서 “한국의 실리콘밸리”라고 불립니다.

- be called ~ : ~라고 불리다

For example, Naver which is the Korean version of Google, built its headquarters in Pangyo, and Kakao which is the most well-known IT company in my country, also opened its offices there.
 → 예를 들어, 네이버가 판교에 본사를 세웠고, 카카오도 사무실을 열었습니다.

- headquarters (헤드쿼터즈) : 본사
- open offices : 사무실을 열다

~~These two companies are very famous in South Korea,~~ so the area soon became a tech hub.
 → 이 두 회사는 한국에서 매우 유명해서, 그 지역은 곧 기술 중심지가 되었습니다.

- tech hub : 기술 중심지

Next, **life there** has also gotten a lot better.
 → 다음으로, 그곳의 생활도 훨씬 나아졌습니다.

In the past, there were only a few restaurants and small stores, so people often went to Seoul for shopping or entertainment.
 → 과거에는 식당과 작은 가게 몇 개만 있어서, 사람들은 쇼핑이나 여가를 위해 종종 서울에 갔습니다.

But today, Pangyo has modern shopping malls, trendy cafes, and cultural spaces.
 → 하지만 오늘날 판교에는 현대적인 쇼핑몰, 세련된 카페, 문화 공간이 있습니다.

- trendy cafes : 세련된 카페

~~A large department store opened,~~ and now many families spend their weekends there.
 → 대형 백화점도 생겨서, 이제 많은 가족들이 주말을 그곳에서 보냅니다.

Because of that, the area feels more vibrant[바이브런트] than before.
 → 그 덕분에, 이 지역은 전보다 더 활기차게 느껴집니다.

- vibrant : 활기찬

**When it comes to** South Korea’s relationship with other countries, I'd like to talk about two things I mean diplomacy and the economy with Japan.

**First**, South Korea and Japan share a troubled past.
Because of history, many South Koreans still have negative feelings toward Japan.
But recently, both sides have tried to ease tensions and get closer.
There have been more talks, visits, and efforts to build trust step by step.
This August, the leaders of South Korea and Japan held a summit meeting and announced a joint statement for the first time in 17 years.
It was just one meeting, but I think it showed that both countries are trying to move forward.

**Next**, the two countries also have strong **economic connections**.
Japan is one of South Korea’s biggest trading partners.
South Korea buys machines and materials needed to make semiconductors, while many South Korean products like electronics and cosmetics are sold in Japan.
**For instance**, in 2019 Japan restricted some key semiconductor materials.
Companies like Samsung and SK Hynix were affected, but Japanese suppliers also lost business because South Korea was their biggest customer.
This incident clearly showed how much the two countries depend on each other. **Since I work in the semiconductor field, I know very well how serious this issue was.**

**Overall, South Korea and Japan are closely connected.**

### 15. 주변국과 역사적 사건... 관계에 영향을 준 것... 문화행사(올림픽)...... 대통령이나 장관이 방문.... ✅😇

**When it comes to** an event with a neighboring country, I'd like to talk about the **tariff issue with the U.S. in 2025**.

**First**, earlier this year, the Trump administration announced a **25% tariff** on South Korean exports.
This was a big problem because the U.S. is one of South Korea’s major markets
South Korean companies worried about losing sales, and many people were concerned about jobs and higher prices.

**Next**, in July 2025, South Korea’s Industry Minister went to Washington, D.C. and met with the U.S. Commerce Secretary.
After hard negotiations, the two sides reached an agreement.
The tariff was reduced from **25% to 15%**, and South Korea promised about **350 billion dollars of investment** in the U.S. / in semiconductors, energy, and shipbuilding.
It was not an easy deal, but it helped keep trade stable and calm the markets.

**Personally**, I was very interested in this issue because tariffs can have a huge impact on the economy.
I felt relieved that the two countries managed to reach a reasonable agreement before things got worse.

**Overall**, this is the recent event with a neighboring country in my country.

## 산업

### 1. 너네 나라 잘알려진 산업 ✅😇

> - 반도체
> - 첫째, 반도체 강국이다
>   - 1980년 부터 정부와 회사가 have invested heavily in research
>   - 절반 이상 메모리 반도체 생산
>   - 수출품목 1등
> - 둘째, 반도체는 미래 산업임
>   - Nvidia GPU에 90% HBM을 생산 
>   - 16.5 빌리언 테슬라 계약 함
> - 비즈니스 이상 경제의 기반이자, 자부심의 원천

**When it comes to** a well-known industry in my country, I’d like to talk about the semiconductor industry.

**First**, South Korea is a global powerhouse in semiconductors.
 Since the 1980s, the government and companies have invested heavily in research, and the industry has grown very quickly.
 Today, South Korea produces over half of the world’s memory semiconductors, and it’s even the country’s number one export item.
 Considering Korea’s technology level back then, I think this was truly an amazing achievement.

**Next**, semiconductors are also the key to the future.
 SK Hynix currently produces about 90% of the HBM chips that NVIDIA uses in its GPUs, which are essential for AI.
 And according to an article I read recently, Samsung signed a $16.5 billion deal with Tesla to supply AI chips.
 They show that South Korean companies are not only strong today but also playing a key role in the future of global technology.

**Personally**, I think semiconductors are more than just a business.
 They are the foundation of our economy and also a source of pride.

**Overall**, I believe semiconductors are South Korea’s most important industry.

**When it comes to** a problem I had at home with my family, **I’d like to talk about** an episode with our **door lock**.

**First**, one day the door handle broke, and we couldn’t open the door from the inside.
It wasn’t a battery issue — the handle just stopped working, so the door wouldn’t open at all.
Since we live on the 24th floor, going out through the window was impossible.
So my wife and I had no choice but to take a half day off from work.
At that moment, it felt strange and even a little scary.

**Next**, we called a locksmith for help.
At first, even he didn’t know what to do, so we ended up talking on the phone with the door stuck between us.
Now that I think about it, that situation was actually pretty funny.
In the end, he had to break the lock completely and replace it with a new one, which had a much sturdier handle.
Looking back, it was ridiculous that we got stuck in our own apartment, but at least now we can laugh about it.

**Overall**, it was a silly but very memorable experience with my family.

**When it comes to** houses in South Korea, **I’d like to talk about** safety and convenience.

**First**, people are much more concerned about safety.
In South Korea, most people live in apartment complexes.
Now, parking lots are built underground, and the ground level is completely car-free, used only for parks and walking paths.
**When I was little**, cars and motorcycles used to drive around on the ground, and it was quite dangerous. I even had a close call with a motorcycle while playing with my friends. Luckily, nothing serious happened.
But now, with cars kept underground, the area has become much safer. These days, parents feel more comfortable letting their kids play outside.

**Next**, life at home is a lot more convenient.
New apartments in South Korea have smart home systems.
**When I visited my friend’s new place**, he had a control panel on the wall and also used his phone. He could control the lights, appliances, and even the front door lock.
When his car entered the parking lot, the air conditioner and lights turned on automatically.
I thought it was really cool, and I hope I can live in a smart home like that someday.

**Overall,** homes today are much easier and more comfortable to live in than before.

### 15. 세들어 사는 것에 대해서 발생하는 문제와, 이를 어떻게 처리하고, 어떤 영향들을 주고 있는지 🏠

> Broker fee.....application 을 통한 직거래
>
> 렌트료 빌싼건 .... 국가에서 보조, 세금 감면..
>
> 비싼 렌트료, 수리 잘안해줌, 간섭문제... 계약서... 

**When it comes to** renting in my country, **I’d like to talk about** the cost.

**First**, broker fees are very high.
You have to pay a big fee to the agent, and sometimes it feels like paying another month’s rent.
That’s just too much for many people.
Because of that, more people try to make direct deals through local communities or apps.
**For example**, in South Korea there’s a second-hand app called Carrot Market, and people use it to make direct deals for small places like studios.

**Next**, monthly rent and maintenance fees are another problem.
If you’re a tenant, you don’t really have the freedom to change things in the home.
Even small things, like putting a nail in the wall or installing an air conditioner, need the landlord’s permission.
**For example**, when I lived in a small studio, there was no air conditioner.
So I bought a used one and installed it, but I had to leave it behind when I moved out.
At that time, I felt it was really unfair, because I paid for it with my own money but still couldn’t take it with me.

**Overall**, I think these are some problems when we talk about renting.

### 14. 가전 제품으로 과거 현재 변화, 가사노동에 준 영향

> 건조기, 세탁기 일체형... IoT로 다 묶임, 멀티쿠커, 가스스토브 > 인덕션

**When it comes to home appliances,** there are clear differences between the past and the present.

**First,** I’d like to talk about **all-in-one appliances.**
These days, many appliances are combined into one product, and it’s becoming a big trend.
**For example,** I recently bought an LG all-in-one washer and dryer.
In the past, moving laundry from the washer to the dryer was such a hassle.
Now, I don’t have to worry about that anymore, and I’m really pleased because I also don’t need to keep track of the washer’s timer.

**Next,** many appliances are connected through the internet.
Most home appliance brands provide their own IoT platforms.
**For example,** most of the appliances in my home are LG products, and I can control everything with my smartphone.
The app even tells me when I need to replace parts or consumables.
I love it because I don’t have to hunt for the remote anymore.

**Overall,** modern appliances save me time and effort, and they make daily life much more convenient.

### 사고싶은 가구에 대해서 질문하기

> Q. I am going to give you a situation to act out. Imagine that you have gone to a store to buy new furniture. Ask you salesperson three or four questions about the furniture you are looking for.

Hi there, my name is Sam.

I’m looking for a new sofa for my living room, and this one really caught my attention.
So, I'd like to ask you some questions.

First, is this sofa available for 6 people. I mean mush larger sized one?
I like lying down on the sofa, but this one looks a little small for that.

Next, what kind of warranty does it come with? 
Since a sofa is a big investment for me, I'd like to make sure it’s well-covered just in cases when the parts of the sofa including springs or frames happen to be broken.

Lastly, When can I received sofa if I order it today?
I hope to have it delivered until next month, so I’m wondering if that’s possible.

That’s all I needed to know for now.

Hello, there. This is Kay who have been a long-time member of your gym.

My wallet is a black leather one from Tom Brown.

Actually, I'm not sure about it

I know you’re probably super busy, but could you take a quick look around treadmills? 

I’m really concerned because there is a lot of cash because today is when I receive my weekly paycheck. 

If you find it, could you please hold on to it? 

I know it’s almost closing time, but I am on my way to the gym, so it will take about 30 minutes for me to get there

When I get my wallet back, I’ll make it worth your while.

### 가구 배송 오류 상황 설명하고 대안 제시하기.

Hello there, this is Nick
I'm calling because there are some problems with the furniture I ordered.

Also, the sofa’s packaging was already removed, so I think there was a big problem during delivery.

### 친구에게 질문 새 치과 의사 찾어

Hey John,

I actually moved close to your neighborhood recently.

Which means I need to find a new dentist around here instead of sticking with my old one.

The dentist you go to sounds nice. Can I ask you a few questions?

So, “How long has the dentist been practicing?”
I want someone with plenty of experience, especially for wisdom tooth extractions.

Is the dentist friendly and patient?”
Because I get nervous at the dentist, I’d feel better with someone who explains things well.

Can children get treated there too?”
→ I’m asking because it looks like my kid might have a cavity.

Is it easy to make an appointment there?
I don’t want to wait too long if I’m in pain.

### 치과를 예약했는데, 이머전시 발생

I was supposed to get my wisdom tooth taken out that day, but I don’t think it’ll work because I’ve got an important presentation.
Since I’ll have to talk a lot, I’m worried it’ll be tough if I get the extraction right before.

Could I reschedule my appointment?

If that’s not possible, could I cancel it for now and maybe just get some painkillers instead?

When it comes to my dental experiences, the one I remember the most is about my wisdom teeth.



First, I went to the dentist because I had a cavity in one of them.

I was so scared of dental work that I decided to just get all 4 pulled at once.

Looking back, I have no idea why I thought that was a good idea.



Next, the recovery was pretty rough. 

I could barely eat for like a week. 

I could only eat soft stuff, like mashed potatoes or soup.

(you know?) It was painful, but I kept telling myself, like, "hey, it’s worth it". 

At least I don’t have to go back to the dentist again.

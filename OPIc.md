Hi there, How are you? 
My Korean name is *Jiseo Son* and my English name is *Sam*
Recently I have a problem. 

I used to travel abroad at least twice a year.
But, I've been too busy with work. So, I haven't been able to travel for the past 2 years.
I really love experiencing new cultures such as the foods, the people, the language and so on.
So, I'm planning to travel to New york this year. 
I want to make lots of great memories by talking with local people and getting to know their culture
That's actually the reason I started studying English.

Ava, I'm very nervous right now. Because of this OPIc test.
But, I'll try to do my best for getting high score.
Wish me good luck, Bye

## Movies

### 1. Genres / types / kinds

내 생각에 나는 로맨스 영화를 즐겨요

첫 번째로, 로맨틱 영화는 내가 많은 여러 감정을 느끼게 해줘요
예를 들어, 영화 미 비퓨 유에서 남자가 서서히 사랑을 느끼는 걸 보여줘요
이건 단순히 사랑에 빠지는 행복 뿐 아니라, 그것과 함께오는 슬픔도 있어요.

다음으로, 로맨틱 영화는 내가 중요한 것들을 가르쳐줘요
로맨틱 영화들은 단지 사랑이랑 감정만 다루지 않아요
그것들은 사랑하는 사람과 보낸 시간을 보여줘요
예를 들어 어바웃 타임이 나의 가장 좋아하는 로맨틱 영화인데,
그 영화에서, 주인공은 과거로 시간여행을 해요 사랑하는 순간들로
하지만 그는 여행을 할때마다, 좋은 추억이 사라지는 것을 깨달아요

이런 이유로 나는 로맨스 영화를 좋아해요
그것들은 그저 달곰하고 즐겁지만 않고 때때로 슬프기도 해요
하지만 그것들은 내가 생각하게 만들어요 내가 사랑하는 사람들에 대해

I think I love enjoying romance films

First of all, romantic movies help me feel many different emotions.
For example, the movie *Me Before You* **shows how man** slowly starts to feel love.
It's not just about the happiness of being in love, but also the sadness that can come with it.

Next, romantic movies teach me something important.
They don't just handle the feeling of love.
They show about spending time with someone you love
For example, About Time is my favorite romatic movie.
in the movie, the main character does time travel to go back to the moments of love.
But he realizes that every time he travels, the good memories also disappear.

For these reasons, I like romance movies.
They are not just sweet and fun. Sometimes it makes me sad.
But, They make me think again about the people I love.

### 2. Actors

I like Jim Carrey the most.

The first reason is he is very ~~h~~umorous.
For example, the first movie I saw him was Truman**'s** show.
In that movie, I realized that a person can make others happy just with facial expressions.
To be honest, I'm not good at showing my emotions, That's something I really want to learn and improve.

예를 들어 내가 그를 처음본 영화 트루먼 쇼를 보면
그 영화에서 나는 깨닳았어요 한 사람이 다른 사람들 표정만으로도 행복하게 할 있다는 것을
솔직하게, 나는 감정표현이 잘 못해요. 그래서 그건 정말 내가 배우고 바꿔나가고 싶어요.

Next, He is also good at expressing **delicate** emotions. / 
Some people know him as a funny actor and I also used to think like that.
But after watching the movie Eternal sunshine, I saw a different side of him.
In that movie, he plays a quite and emotional man which is very different from previous roles.
However, he describes feelings of sadness and love really well.
After that, I started to like him as a real actor not just a funny actor.

다음으로 그는 섬세한 감정도 잘 표현해요
누군가는 그가 웃긴 배우로 알고 있어요. 나 역시 그렇게 생각 했어요
하지만 이터널선샤인를 보고 그의 다른 모습을 봤어요
그 영화에서는 그는 조용하고 감수성있는 사람으로 이전 그의 역할과는 상당히 달랐어요
하지만 그는 슬픔과 사람이라는 느낌을 잘 묘사해냈어요
그리고 나는 웃긴 배우가 아닌 진짜 배우로 좋아하기 시작했어요

His recent movie, the sonic series. Actually the role looked too silly for me.
so I haven't watched them.
But, I always try to check if he has new movies coming out. because I'm still a big fan of him.
그의 최근 영화인 소닉 시리즈는 사실 나에겐 너무 우스꽝스러워 보였어요
(새로운 소닉 작품을 한다는걸 뉴스에서 봤다)
그래서 그걸은 본적은 없어요
하지만 항상 확인하고 있어요 그가 새로운 영화에 나오는지, 왜냐면 난 여전히 그의 팬이에요.

Overall, I really favor him the best

종합적으로 나는 그를 정말 좋아해요

### 2. Routine/ Before and after movies

> Before / Concession stand(매점), window shopping, purchase tickets(how)
> After / Eat out, 결말찾아보기, 스포해버리기, give a.rating, goods 사기

> [루틴 문제] - 1 to 2 mins
>
> When it comes to **going to the movies**, I have some routines.
> First, **before movies**,
> Next, **after movies**,
>
> Overall, these are my routines.

영화를 보러가는 것에 대해, 나는 루틴이 있다.
When it comes to going to the movies, I have some routines.

첫째로, 영화를 보기전
나는 보통 누구와 영화를 볼 지 찾는다. 왜냐면 난 혼자 영화를 보지 않는다.
보통은 가족 혹은 친구와 같이 간다.
그리고 무엇을 볼지 정한다. 대부분의 경우 난 그들의 의견을 따른다.
그리고, 우리는 티켓, 팝콘, 소다를 산다

First, before movies. 
I usually figure out who I'm going with, because I've never watched a movie alone at the theater.
I normally go there with my friend or family.
Then, we decide what to watch. In most cases, I follow their opinion .
After that we purchase our tickets, popcorn and soda.

다음으로 영화를 보고 난후
나는 내 좌석을 청소하고, 그들에게 영화가 어땠는지 물어본다.
그리고 우리는 식사를 하고 영화에 대해서 더 이야기 한다.
만약 그 영화가 좋거나 실망스러우면, 인터넷에 평점도 남긴다.

Next, after movies, I clean up and organize my seat and ask them how the movie is.
And we have a meal and talk more about the movie.
If the movie is great or disappointing, I make sure to leave a rating about the movie.

Overall, these are my routines.

### 3. Memorable movie / (worst movie 도 이름만 생각해보기)

> 배우들 이름 2~3명, 감독 이름
> 줄거리는 최소한 + 나의 생각
> Also, 좋아하는 이유 + 기억에 나는 장면
> 마무리, 친구에게 추천한다 / I would recommend this movie to my friends.

내게 가장 기억에 남는 영화는 보헤미안 랩소디 입니다.
사실 영화관에서 유일하게 2번 본 영화기도 합니다.

One of the most memorable movies is *Bohemian Rhapsody*.
It's actually the only one movie I've watched twice in the theater.

첫째, Freddie Mercury를 연기한 Rami Malek 은 굉장한 배우입니다.
그는 단순히 프레디 머큐리처럼 보이는게 아니다. 그는 그의 감정을 잘 표현한다.

First, Rami Malek who played Freddie Mercury was an amazing actor.
He didn’t just look like Freddie Mercury, he captured his emotions well, too.

또한, 스토리라인이 완벽하다. 그 영화는 전설적인 밴드 퀸의 이야기와 여정를 이야기하고 있어요.

Next, the storyline is just perfect.
It tells the story of the legendary rock band Queen and their journey.

사실, 그들의 노래는 많이 들었지만, 퀸이 누구인지는 궁금해 한 적 없다.
그렇다고 해서 이 영화는 그저 유명인의 삶을 다룬 지루한 다큐가 아니다.
그들의 노래 하나하나가 그들에게 어떤 의미인지 보여준다.

To be honest, I've heard their songs many times before, but I've never wondered who they were.
Anyway, It wasn't one of those boring documentaries about celebrity's life.
It shows what each of their songs are meant to them.

내가 가장 좋아하는 장면은 그들이 보헤미안 랩소디를 첫곡으로 아주 큰 스타디움에서 공연하는 건데,
나는 그 노래를 들을 때 마다, 나는 그 스타디움의 사람들 중 하나가 되는 기분을 느낀다.
아마도 영화 이름이 퀸이 아니라 보헤미안 랩소디인 이유가 아닐까?

My favorite scene is when they perform Bohemian Rhapsody as the opening song at a large stadium. 
Whenever I listen to that song, I feel like I'm one of the people in that stadium.
Maybe that's why the movie is titled as Bohemian Rhapsody, not Queen.

결론적으로, 보헤미안 랩소디는 내게 있어 기억에 남는 것 이상으로 잊지 못할 영화이다
Overall, The movie Bohemian Rhapsody is more than just memorable. It's unforgettable for me.

### 13. 영화과 너무 노잼 인데, 떠나고 싶어요

Hey, Brian

I'm sorry I have a problem with this movie.
The problem is that I feel really bored with the movie.

I haven't seen the previous movies in the series, so I couldn't really understand the story.
Also, the actor's acting was so bad. I cannot focus on it.

Maybe it’s because I don’t really know who the actors are.

to fix this problem, I have two alternatives.
so I’ll go ahead and wait at Starbuck while reading some books.
Alternatively, maybe we could go out together and watch the previous movies in the series at home. 
They will be still fun to watch them again.
Anyway, please let me know the best option.



### 14. 과거 vs 현재 뭐가 다르냐? (시제가 과거랑 현재가 섞임)

> There are some differences between the past and present about **movies**.
>
> First, in the past/Back then
>
> However, these days / But now
>
> Overall, 각자 알아아서 생각
>
> - CGI: Computer Generated Imagery

과거와 현재의 영화에는 조금 차이 점이 있다.

There are some differences between the past and present about **movies**



첫째로 과거에는 사람의 재능이 더 중요했다

배우는 모든 것을 잘해야 했다. 연기, 액션씬, 감정표현 등

그리고 감독은 영화를 진짜처럼 만들기 위해 모든 것을 했다.

내 생각에 오늘날까지 대부분 유명한 배우들과 감독들은 그 시절 등장했다. 톰크루즈나 크리스토퍼 놀란 같은

First, in the past, Human talent was much more important.

Actors had to be good at every thing such as acting, action scenes, emotional expressions and so on.

And Directors had to put every thing together to make the movie like real,

I think most of the famous actors and directors we still know today came from that time like Tom Cruise and Christopher Nolan.



하지만 오늘날은 영화제작의 많은 부분이 디지털 기술로 대체되었다.

배우는 더이상 위험한 씬을 하지 않아도 되고, 감독은 실제 촬영장 구성에 많은 노력을 투자하지 않아도 된다.

그럼에도 CGI가 우리에게 이전 보다 훨씬 인상적인 영화를 경험할 수 있게 해준다.

However, these days, Many parts of production have been replaced by digital technology

Actors no longer have to do dangerous scenes and directors don't have to put much effort into building real sets

Even so, CGI which stands for Computer Generated Imagery helps us experience movies in a more impressive way than before.

==For example, the movie *Avatar* has remarkable visual effects, regardless of the storyline.==

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Regardless 발음, For example 

결국 내 생각에는 최고 영화들은 CGI는 서포트만 하고, 사람의 재능이 잘 지켜져야 할 것 같다.

Overall, I think the best movies come out when CGI supports human talent while preserving it.

### 15. 요즘 영화에 관해서 사람들이 말하는 우려, 걱정

> 영화관을 잘 안가는 거, Streaming platform, Expensive ticket price, (+News 사례)
>
> When it comes to concerns in the **movie industry**, people are talking about ____.
>
> 흔해빠진? 쿠키 커러 , 포뮬레잌, 프레딕터블
>
> Theater attendance = 관객.
>
> 할리우드 트럼프 관세, tariff (만능)
>
> 기사 출저? According to the article in CNN, 예시
> I read an interesting article form NY times the other day,
> Also(Next), 나의 의견과 감정을 표현해낸다.(main idea)

> 주제 : AI 
> Contents : 일자리 감소(작가, CG작업), Creative 감소, 예시

When it comes to concerns in the movie industry, people say that the traditional side is struggling these days.

영화 산업에 대한 걱정에 대해서, 사람들은 요즘 기존의 산업이 축소되는 것을 말한다.

First, people don’t go to the theater **as often as** they used to.
For me, I go to the theater maybe once a year, **if at all.**
That's because these days there are many streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon prime.
People can watch movies at home in a comfortable atmosphere without going to the theater.
They can even **enjoy** them with their favorite food, not just popcorn or soda.

첫쨰, 사람들이 예전처럼 영화관에 잘 가지 않음

나도 아마 일년에 한번 갈까함

왜냐면, 요즘 스트리밍 플랫폼이 많음 : 넷플릭스, 디즈니 플러스

사람은 집에서 그냥 영화볼 수 있음 편안한 분위기에서, 영화관에 안가고

심지어 최애 음식이랑 즐길 수 있음, 팝콘 소다 말고

Next, there is the recent tariff issue. [태맆]

The Trump administration has announced several new policies about tariffs, and the movie industry is no exception.

I don’t remember the exact title. But according to a CNN article I read recently, they decided to impose a 100% tariff **on** the movie industry **as well.(역시)**

There might be some reasons or positions between the countries, but **from** my experience, tariff issues usually end up affecting consumers.

Even in Korea, we already pay more than 20 dollars per person to watch a movie at the theater.

Ticket prices are already high, and **extra tariffs** could make it worse.

So, I’m worried that this will make people spend even less.

다음, 최근 관세 문제가 있음

트럼프 정부는 몇가지 관세 정책를 발표함, 영화도 예외는 없음

정확히 제목은 기억안나지만, 내가 최근에 본 CNN 기사에 따르면, 100퍼 영화에도 관세 부과하기로 함.

뭐 나라간 각자 이유나 입장이 있겠지만 내 경험상 관세는 결국 소비자한테 영향을 줌

한국에서도, 이미 인당 20달러 넘게 냄 영화관에서 영화보는데,

티켓 값 이미 비싼데, 추가 관세는 이걸 더 안좋게 할 것 같음

사람들이 돈 더 안쓰게 만들까봐 걱정임

Overall, I think these are some of the main concerns in today’s movie industry.

## Musics

### 1. Genre

**I think I really enjoy** jazz music. To be more specific, I prefer jazz pop to traditional jazz.

**First,** jazz has special charm that draws me in before I know it.
I remember the first time I went to a jazz bar with my friends.
I used to listen to K-pop, so jazz was a completely / new kind of music to me.
To be honest, I thought a jazz bar was / nothing more than a fancy bar.
However, **at some point**, I realized that we were just sitting there, focused on the stage.
We stopped talking and started imagining the meaning behind the lyrics.

**Next,** Jazz makes me feel **classy**.
Whenever I go through something emotional, I spend some time alone, listening to jazz.
One of my favorite songs is Don't Know Why by Norah Jones.
When I close my eyes and listen, **it changes how I feel.**
On good days, it makes me feel like a classy gentleman.
On the other hand, On sad days, it makes me feel like the main character in a sad movie.
Jazz makes my emotions feel more meaningful and deep.

**Overall,** these are the reasons why I love jazz(줴즈) music.

### 2. routine (2 mins under)

> 육하원칙
>
> - 일할 때 / 쉴 때 / 운전할 때
> - 노래 제목 가수, 나의 일상
>   - 공부나 일, 집중, 업빝송즈
>   - 노이즈캔슬링
>   - 째

**When it comes to** / listening to music, / **I have some routines.**
And It depends on situations.

**First,** when I listen to music while working or studying, I need to stay focused.
So, I usually listen to upbeat songs with little or no meaningful lyrics, like EDM or some K-pop songs.
Among them, my favorite song is The Drum by Alan Walker.
This song makes me feel excited and energetic, it helps me work or study more effectively.
Also, I always make sure to listen to them using my noise-cancelling AirPods.

**The next routine is about** the music I listen to when I drive.
Driving is one of the few times I’m alone, so I listen to jazz which is my favorite genre[쟌러].
That's because I can sing along without worrying about anyone hearing me.
Naturally, I turn up the volume and let the music fill the car

**Overall,** these are my routines about the music.



### 3. 나의 음악감상, 과거/현재 비교

> Overall these are differences.
>
> - K-pop, Idols -> girl groups (예브고 신난, 중독성, 단순한 멜로디, 따라 부르기 좋음) / 소시, 원더걸스, Hook song
> - However, These days, ----------- because of 나 due to 원인 간단하게?
>
> 톤업, 혀굴리기, 루즈함

나의 음악 취향에 대해서, 과거와 현재에 일부 차이점이 있다.

~~물론 음악 트랜드가 많이 변했지만, 나의 음악 취향이 어떻게 변했는지 말해주고싶어.~~

**When it comes to** my music tastes, **there are some differences between the past and the present.**

~~Although music trends have changed over time with each generation, I'd like to focus more on how my music taste has evolved.~~

첫째, 과거에는, 나는 신나는 음악이나 따라부리기 좋은 노래를 선호했다
왜냐면 내가 어릴때 나는 자주 친구들과 가라오케에서 시간을 보냈다.
거기서 우리는 대부분 K-POP을 불렀는데, 그것들이 따라 부르기도 쉽고 신나는 노래들이였다.
누가 뭐래도, 그 순간들 만큼은 우리는 아이돌이 된 것처럼 노래를 불렀다.

**First, in the past,** I used to prefer upbeat songs or ones that were easy to sing along to, like K-pop.
That’s because, when I was younger, I often spent time with my friends at karaoke.[ki]
We mostly sang K-pop songs there, and they were not only easy to sing along. but also energetic and fun.
No matter what anyone said, in those moments, we sang like we were real idols.

하지만, 지금은, 나는 차분하고 조용한 음악을 선호한다
삶이 바빠지면서, 나는 음악을 신나기 위해서 보단 쉬기위해서 듣는다.
게다가 나이를 먹으며, 가사의 숨은 의미를 더 잘 이해하게 됐는데,
이런 이유로 나는 내가 더를 더 감동시키는 내가 말한 음악들을 좋아한다
최근에는 노러 죤즈의 선라이즈를 듣고 있는데, 평온한 삶을 상상하게 해준다.

**However, these days,** I prefer calm and quiet music.
As my life has gotten busier, I listen to music to relax, not to get excited.
What’s more, as I’ve grown older, I’ve started to understand the meaning behind lyrics more deeply
Because of that, I like the kind of music I mentioned earlier, which touches me more emotionally.
Recently, I’ve been listening to "Sunrise" by Norah Jones and it helps me imagine a peaceful life.

한가지 변치 않는건, 둘다 여전히 나를 기쁘게 해준다

One thing that hasn’t changed is both still give me pleasure.

전체적으로 이것들이 오늘과 과거의 차이다.

**Overall,** these are the differences between the past and the present.

### 3. 콘서트(Concert or Live music) 들은 경험,언제,누구랑,누구의 공유

> 장소, 시간, 누구랑, 누구의 
>
> 시간순으로 (특히 처음 순간)

사실 나는 콘서트에 많이 가보지 않았습니다.
내가 가본 유일한 콘서트는 한국의 유명한 가수 성시경 콘서트 였습니다.
이 콘서트는 연세대에서 2023년에 열렸고, 나의 와이프와 함께 갔었습니다.
Actually, I haven’t been to many concerts. 
The only concert I’ve ever been to was by Sung Si Kyung, who is a well-known Korean singer.
It was held at Yonsei University in 2023, and I went there with my wife.

Listening to a song live was not only more impressive than the recorded one, but it's also a fantastic experience where I could feel the energy of the crowd.
Following the crowd, I waved my hands, clapped along to the beat, cheered loudly, and sang along with the songs.
Those are moments I still remember clearly.

And I remember the ticket was over 100 dollars per person. 
Actually, It's pretty expensive for me.
But when I think about how touching that moment was, the price didn’t matter at all.
I'd gladly go again anytime as long as I'm with the people I love

> Bose : Ultra open earbuds / 보우즈

**When it comes to** the latest electronic music gadgets(devices), 

I think **people are talking about** open-ear earbuds these days.

최신 전자 음향기기에 대해, 사람들은 오픈 이어 이어버즈를 이야기함



**First,** I'd like to tell you about the open-ear earbuds in detail.

오픈 이어 이어버즈에 대해서 이야기하고 싶음

They’re kind of a new style of earbuds.

새로움 스타일의 이어버즈임

Normally, earbuds go directly into your ears, but these don't.

보통 이버즈는 귓구멍에 직접 꽂는데, 이것들은 안그럼

<u>They just</u> hang on your ears like earrings.

그냥 귀에 귀걸이처럼 검

Out of all the new products coming out these days, I think the Ultra Open Earbuds from Bose are the best.

많은 제품 중에, 보스의 울트라 오픈 이어버즈가 최고임

Since it’s a new style, it might look pretty unusual at first.

But this product has a really cool design, so it actually looks great.

And of course, the most important thing is the sound quality — but it’s Bose, so there’s no need to say more.

너도 알다 시피, 보스는 이미 사운드에 돼해서는 잘 알려져있음



**Also,** I really want to purchase them

물론 나도 그걸 가지고 싶음

I already have AirPods Pro which is the most popular, but wearing regular in-ear earbuds like them for a long time is painful for my ears.

보통 인이어 이어버즈 오래 쓰면 귀가 아픔

So I can’t wear them for more than two hours.

그래서 나는 두시간 이상 못씀

According to many reviews on the official website, 

these don’t hurt users ears, so they can solve that problem.

근데 이건 이걸 해결해줄 수 있음

What’s more, they’re lightweight and let me hear the sounds around me while listening to music, 

so I can keep them on all day

더해서, 그것들은 가볍고 음악과 함께 주변소리를 들을 수 있어서 하루종일 착용 가능



**Overall,** I think open-ear earbuds are the latest type of earbuds.

## 공원

### 공원 설명

나는 공원에 가서 시간을 보내는 걸 좋아한다

단순히 가는 것만으로 건강해지는 기분이다.

**I think** I love going to a park and spending time there.

Just going to a park makes me feel healthier.



첫째로 불당공원이 내가 좋아하고 자주 가는 곳인데.

공원은 내가 사는 천안시의 시청 옆에 있다.

주로 날씨가 좋으면 일요일 마다 간다.

강아지도 허용되어 있어 나를 포함한 많은 사람들이 강아지와 산책을 한다.

**First,** I think Buldang Park is the one I like and visit most often.

The park is located next to City Hall in Cheonan, where I live.

I usually go there on Sundays if the weather is nice.

Since dogs are allowed==[얼라우드]== there, a lot of people, including me, enjoy walking their dogs.



다음, 그리고 내가 거길 좋아하는 몇가지 이유가 있는데,

나는 큰 공원을 좋아하는데, 근처에서 가장 큰 공원이다.

그리고 깨끗한 화장실과 많은 벤치, 야외운동시설이 있다.

더해 말하면, 항상 클래식 음악을 틀어주고, 그곳에 나무로 둘러쌓은 둘레길이 있다

거기를 노래를 들으며 걸으면 숲속에 있는 기분이다.

**Next,** there are some reasons why I like there

I usually prefer bigger parks, and this one is the biggest neaby.

And it has clean restrooms, lots of benches, and some outdoor gym equipment.

What’s more, they always play classical music, and there's a trail along a tree-covered hill.

When I walk along there while listening to the music, it feels like I’m in a forest.



**Overall,** that’s why I really like this park.

**When we talk about** going to a park, **I have some routines**



**First**, before I go to a park,

I usually check the weather because I like sunny days the most.

Then, I try to find a park near my place

Of course, I also make sure the park allows dogs to walk my dog.

After that, I change into comfortable clothes and prepare dog waste bags and some cold water.



**Next,** when I arrive at a park, 

I put a harness(하네스) on my dog and plan our walking route.

Actually, I usually just walk instead of running.

During the walk, I sometimes sit on a bench and take a short break

Sometimes I throw my dog’s toys and play with her. I also take selfies with her to post on Instagram.



**Overall,** these are my routines when I go to a park.

### Memorable park 사건

> 방학숙제 사기 치기,
> homework는 불가산 명사 + assignments 붙이기

**I think** the most memorable event in a park for me was golfing there.

**First,** to be more specific about it, 

it was when I was around thirteen.

In Korea, vacation homework is important.

At that time, one of my vacation assignments  was to experience a new outdoor activity.

Since the vacation was almost over, I decided to play golf which is my father’s hobby.

I took the shortest one of my father's golf clubs and went to the park nearby.

Then, I tried to imitate *Tiger Woods*’s swing I had looked up on the internet.

To be exact, I didn’t actually play golf, I just pretended to, because I only did practice swings without a ball.

When I think about how ridiculous I must have looked to people, it still makes me laugh.

**Overall,** I’ve actually started learning real golf now, but I will never play golf in a park again.

**Hi Angela, This is Sam.**
**I'm calling because I'd like to** go to the park we went before together
It's been a long time since we hung out.
**So, let me ask you some questions**

**First,** Are you free this Saturday, I mean the 16th?
According to the weather forecast, it’s gonna be really sunny.

**Next,** Can I bring my dog so we can go for a walk together?
Because you told me before you wanted to see her.

**Lastly**, I can pick you up by my car. How about meeting in front of the CVS near your place?

**Anyway, please call me back when you get this. Bye.**

### 12.친구와 공원가기로 이미 했는데, 나의 사정으로 약속을 취소해야함. 대안 2개

**Hi Angela, this is Sam.**

We are supposed to go to the park this Saturday, right?

I’m really sorry, but I **won’t be able to make it.**

That’s because I completely forgot it’s my wife’s birthday on that day. 

And as you know, my wife can be pretty scary. 

I was really looking forward to having chicken and beer at the park together,

 so I’m really disappointed.

**To fix the problem, I have two alternatives.**
**First,** how about going to a nearby park tonight?
I can purchase some snacks and beer by CVS in front of the park.

**Alternatively,** how about rescheduling for next Saturday?
Of course, the chicken and beer will be on me.

Again, I’m really sorry.
**please let me know the best option. Bye**

### 13. 기억에 남는 사건 (재탕)

> Overall, 

**When it comes to** activities in a park, **there are some differences and similarities between** children **and** adults.

공원에서의 활동에 대해, 애랑 어른이랑 좀 차이가 있음



**First,** As for/Regarding adults' activities in a park.

They usually go for a walk or sometimes do light jogging.

Some people run in groups, and running crews are a big trend in South Korea right now.

Sometimes they bring food and drinks to have a picnic, and parents take photos while playing with their kids.

In my opinion, adults usually spend more time relaxing or making memories than doing active things.

첫째, 어른들의 공원활동

그들은 산책 or 가벼운 조깅

일부는 무리지어 뜀, 러닝크루는 한국에서 좀 핫함

음식이랑 마실것 들고 피크닉도 종종 함, 부모들은 애들이랑 노는걸 사진 찍음

내 생각에 어른은 활동적인 것보다 쉬거나 추억만들기에 시간을 씀



**Next,** As for children's activities in a park.

They do more active things, just like I used to.

For example, they enjoy riding bikes, playing ball games, and running.

Recently, I went to the park near my place with my nephew.

At the park, he was totally in his element.

I was having fun too, but I just couldn’t **keep up with** his energy / 따라 잡다, 뒤쳐지지 않다

I think children use a park to burn energy, while adults use it to recharge.

Still, they each enjoy a place in their own way.

다음, 애들의 공원활동

그들은 더 활동적인걸 함, 나도 그랫듯

예를 들어, 자전거 타고 공놀이하고 달리고

최근에 근처 공원에 조카랑 갔는데

공원에서 그는 미쳤음

나도 재밌었지만, 걔 에너지를 못 따라가겠음

내 생각에 애들은 에너지 쓰기위해 공원을 가고 반면에 어른은 충전하러감

하지만 여전히 그들은 그들의 방식으로 즐김



**Overall, I think these are the differences and smulisd between** children **and** adults.



### 14. 자주 가는 공원 2개 비교

> First, 공통점
>
> ​	사람이 많다. 애완견도 모두 갈 수 있다.
>
> On the other hand, 차이점
>
> ​	편의 시설, 크기, 위치

When it comes to the parks I visit most often, I’d like to talk about Buldang Park and Seongjeong Lake Park, which are my favorites.



First, these two parks have a lot in common.

Both are just about ten minutes from my place, which makes them very convenient to visit.

For me, the best park is close and easy to visit, not just nice-looking.

Of course, both parks allow dogs and are kept clean since they’re managed by my city.

Plus, there’s Starbucks right at the entrance of each park, so I usually grab an iced Americano and walk my dog.

첫째, 두공원 공통점 있음

둘다 우리집에서 10분 거리임, 방문하기에 굉장히 편함

나의 경우, 최고의 공원은 가깝고 가기 좋은 곳임, 보기 좋은게 아니라.

물론 두 공원은 강아지를 데려갈 수 있음 그리고 깨끗함 시에서 관리해서

또한, 스타벅스가 공원 입구에 있어서, 보통 아이스 아메리카노 한잔 사서 강아지랑 산책함



However, there are also some differences.

As you can guess from the names, one has a lake --  and the other doesn’t.

If I wanna walk by the water, I go to Seongjeong Lake Park.

But if I want to walk through the forest, I head to Buldang Park.

Around the lake park, there are fancier coffee shops(coffee houses/places) and restaurants, while the other park feels more like park in the city center.

My dog is a little timid, so when I take her to the more crowded lake park I **keep a / closer eye on** her.

하지만 차이점도 좀 있음

이름에서 알 수 있듯, 하나는 호수가 있고 하나는 없음

내가 물가를 걷고 싶으면 성정 호수 공원을 가고

내가 숲속을 걷고 싶으면 불당 공원을 감

호수공원은 화려한 커피샵과 식당있고, 반면 다른 공원은 일반 도심 공원 같음

내 강아지는 조금 겁쟁이라, 사람 많은 호수공원에 갈때 좀더 신경씀



Overall, these are the similarities and differences between the two parks, they’re both great places to spend time.



### 15. 공공 공원이 직면한 문제

> Public parks face, 문제 2개

When it comes to problems public parks face, people are talking about .... And ...... .

불법 노숙, 캠핑, 음주, 흡연, 공공기물 파손(vandalism),  



When it comes to problems public parks face, people usually talk about drinking and vandalism.

First, one concern is drinking in public parks.
In South Korea, the rules are not very strict about drinking in these places.
I’ve also enjoyed hanging out with friends at Han River Park, drinking beer and eating snacks.
Light drinking, like one or two cans of beer, doesn’t usually cause big problems.
But sometimes, some people get really drunk. They get loud, use bad language, and act rudely.
This is a real problem because many families visit parks, including young children. Such behavior can have a bad influence on the children and disturb their rest.

하나의 걱정은 공원에서 술마시는 거임

한국은 그렇게 술마시는 것에 대해 엄격하지 않음

나도 역시 친구들과 한강에서 맥주와 과자를 먹은 적 있음

맥주 한두캔의 가벼운 음주는 그렇게 큰 문제가 되지 않음

하지만 일부는 만취해서, 고서방가에 욕설에 무례한 짓들을 함

이건 진짜 문제임, 왜냐면 많은 가족들이 오고 애들도 오는데,

그런 행동은 애들한테 나쁜 영향을 주고 평화로운 휴식시간을 방해함

Next, there’s vandalism.

Most parks in South Korea are public spaces.

Some people, including drunk ones, sometimes damage the facilities made for citizens’ convenience.

They might play roughly with the facilities or vandalize public property with graffiti.

For example, just yesterday when I was walking my dog, I saw a bench covered with bad words.

I saw an article recently that said some people even steal plants from parks.

It seems to be a serious global problem.

다음으로 공공기물 파손이 있음

대부분 한국 공원은 공공장소임

술취한 사람을 포함해서 일부 사람들은 가끔 시민들의 편의를 위한 시설들을 부숨

아마도 거칠게 시설물을 가지고 놀거나 그래피티로 공공기물을 부숨

예를 들어 바로 어제 강아지랑 산책을 갔는데, 나쁜말이 가득 적힌 벤치를 봤음

Overall, these are some of the main problems public parks face.





## Domestic trip

### 1. 내가 자주가는 Domestic destinations. 😎

> Let me tell you about my favorite domestic destinatons
>
> - Seoul, a capital city of South Korea.
>
> First,
>
> Also,
>
> Overall,

I think one of my favorite domestic destination is Seoul, the capital city of South Korea.

First, there are many things to enjoy.

I actually live in a quiet countryside town. So when I go on dates or hang out with friends, I often visit Seoul.

That's because there are always new things to experience like night markes, pop-up stores, various events and so on.

For example, last month I tried the service which called “Nike By You"

Nike By You is a service that lets you design your own Nike products.

It’s only available at certain Nike stores in Seoul.



Next, it's very convenient to get around.

In Seoul, I can go anywhere just by subway.

If I set my destination on any popular map application on my phone.

It gives me all the information I need.

For example, it shows the exit number near my destination, the expected train arrival time, and the door number for the fastest transfer.

Even if you miss a train, the next one usually comes within five minutes.

That’s why I never take my own car when I visit the city.



Overall, that’s why I go to Seoul so often.

Hi there, my name is Sam.

I’m looking for a new sofa for my living room, and this one really caught my attention.
So, I'd like to ask you some questions.

First, is this sofa available in a larger size?
I like lying down on the sofa, but this one looks a little small for that.

Next, what kind of warranty does it come with?
Since a sofa is a big investment for me, I want to make sure it’s well covered.

Lastly, what’s the average delivery time if I order today?
I hope to have it before next month, so I’m wondering if that’s possible.

That’s all I needed to know for now.
